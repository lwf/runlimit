# runlimit
runlimit is a rate limiter for process invocations, primarily designed to be used with [daemontools](http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html) and similar process supervisors (think runit, s6, etc).

## Building
Running `make` will produce a statically linked binary in the `target` directory. Debian infrastructure is provided in `debian/` and may be used to produce packages by way of your preferred method (debuild, pbuilder, etc).

## Usage
```shell
runlimit -sv-cmd cmd [-window-size duration] [-max-restarts restarts] [-metadata-dir dir] [-metadata-key key] prog [args...]
```

runlimit will allow `max-restarts` invocations of `prog` within a moving window of `window-size` duration. This is similar to how Upstart's respawn directive works. runlimit will invoke the command specified by the `sv-cmd` flag once the restart limit is reached. This command is expected to send SIGTERM to the runlimit process, as is conventional among daemontools and its clones.

Per-process state information is stored in `metadata-dir`. File names are determined by the `metadata-key` flag if specified or based on the current working directory of the runlimit process.

## Examples
Usage with daemontools:

```shell
# cat > /service/mydaemon/run <<EOF
#!/bin/sh

exec runlimit -window-size 10m -max-restarts 3 \
  -sv-cmd "svc -d `pwd`" mydaemon
EOF
```

Usage with runit:

```shell
# cat > /etc/service/mydaemon/run <<EOF
#!/bin/sh

exec runlimit -window-size 10m -max-restarts 3 \
  -sv-cmd "sv stop `pwd`" mydaemon
EOF
```
